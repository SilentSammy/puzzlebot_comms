+ move algorithms to visual_navigation.py
+ fix direction detection issue
+ allow passing a dedicated drawing frame
+ navigate_track
+ allow passing a decision function to navigate_track
+ reduce follow_line throttle authority according to stoplight, and keep resetting intersection stability timer when stoplight is green
+ allow boolean polling of controller axes
+ calibrate camera
+ finish implementing adaptive threshold in follow_line
+ make simulated track more noisy (seams and shadows)
- implement find_corresponding_point to detect persistent line candidate. for this, make add function called get_persistent_line() to the pipeline
- smarter intersection alignment algorithm
- allow streaming estimated pose
+ return 0.0, 0.0 instead of 0,0
- rename flag_detector package
+ separate videoplayer and visual_navigation
+ don't use undistorted frame
